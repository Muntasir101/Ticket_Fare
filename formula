 formula for calculating the flight cost based on the given requirements:

For flights less than 500 miles:

Flat rate cost: $100
For flights between 500 and 1000 miles:

If departing within 7 days: cost = distance * 0.10
If departing within 30 days: cost = distance * 0.08
If departing within 90 days: cost = distance * 0.06
For flights over 1000 miles:

If departing within 7 days: cost = distance * 0.30
If departing within 30 days: cost = distance * 0.25
If departing within 90 days: cost = distance * 0.20
For service class:

Economy class: no additional cost
Business class: double the cost
First class: triple the cost
