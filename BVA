boundary value analysis to each input parameter:

Distance:
Test case 1: Distance = 499 (just below the lower boundary of 500)
Test case 2: Distance = 500 (at the lower boundary)
Test case 3: Distance = 1000 (at the upper boundary of the 500-1000 range)
Test case 4: Distance = 1001 (just above the upper boundary)

Departure Date:
Test case 1: Departure Date = 6 (within 7 days)
Test case 2: Departure Date = 7 (at the lower boundary)
Test case 3: Departure Date = 30 (at the upper boundary of the 7-30 range)
Test case 4: Departure Date = 31 (just above the upper boundary)

Service Class:
Test case 1: Service Class = "Economy" (no additional cost)
Test case 2: Service Class = "Business" (double the cost)
Test case 3: Service Class = "First" (triple the cost)


Total test case:
In this scenario, we have three input parameters: Distance, Departure Date, and Service Class.

Distance:

Lower Boundary: 500
Lower Boundary - 1: 499
Upper Boundary: 1000
Upper Boundary + 1: 1001
Total boundary values for Distance = 4
Departure Date:

Lower Boundary: 7
Lower Boundary - 1: 6
Upper Boundary: 30
Upper Boundary + 1: 31
Total boundary values for Departure Date = 4
Service Class:

Economy
Business
First
Total boundary values for Service Class = 3
To calculate the total number of test cases, we multiply the number of boundary values for each parameter:
Total test cases = 4 (Distance) * 4 (Departure Date) * 3 (Service Class) = 48
