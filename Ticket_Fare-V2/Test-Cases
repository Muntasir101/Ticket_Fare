Here's a set of test cases based on the formulas and boundary value analysis for each input parameter:

Test Cases for Distance:

Test Case 1: Distance = 499 (just below the lower boundary)
Test Case 2: Distance = 500 (on the lower boundary)
Test Case 3: Distance = 501 (just above the lower boundary)
Test Case 4: Distance = 999 (just below the upper boundary)
Test Case 5: Distance = 1000 (on the upper boundary)
Test Case 6: Distance = 1001 (just above the upper boundary)
Test Cases for Departure Date:

Test Case 7: Departure Date = 6 (just below the lower boundary)
Test Case 8: Departure Date = 7 (on the lower boundary)
Test Case 9: Departure Date = 8 (just above the lower boundary)
Test Case 10: Departure Date = 89 (just below the upper boundary)
Test Case 11: Departure Date = 90 (on the upper boundary)
Test Case 12: Departure Date = 91 (just above the upper boundary)
Test Cases for Extra Baggage:

Test Case 13: Extra Baggage = 0 (no extra baggage)
Test Case 14: Extra Baggage = 1 (minimum valid value)
Test Case 15: Extra Baggage = 5 (any valid positive integer)
Test Case 16: Extra Baggage = 100 (large value)
Test Cases for Service Class:

Test Case 17: Service Class = "Economy"
Test Case 18: Service Class = "Business"
Test Case 19: Service Class = "First"
