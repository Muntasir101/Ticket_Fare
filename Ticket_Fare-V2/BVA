apply boundary value analysis to each input parameter:

Distance:

Lower Boundary: 499 (just below 500)
On Boundary: 500
Upper Boundary: 1000 (just below 1001)


Departure Date:

Lower Boundary: 6 (within 7 days)
On Boundary: 7
Upper Boundary: 90 (just below 91)
Extra Baggage:

Lower Boundary: 0
On Boundary: Any valid positive integer value
Upper Boundary: Any large positive integer value


Service Class:

Lower Boundary: "Economy"
On Boundary: "Business"
Upper Boundary: "First"


Total test case:
In this scenario, we have three input parameters: Distance, Departure Date, and Service Class.

Distance:

Lower Boundary: 500
Lower Boundary - 1: 499
Upper Boundary: 1000
Upper Boundary + 1: 1001
Total boundary values for Distance = 4

Departure Date:

Lower Boundary: 7
Lower Boundary - 1: 6
Upper Boundary: 30
Upper Boundary + 1: 31
Total boundary values for Departure Date = 4


Service Class:
Economy
Business
First

Total boundary values for Service Class = 3

To calculate the total number of test cases based on the boundary values,
we multiply the number of boundary values for each parameter. In this case, we have:

Distance: 4 test cases (4 boundary values)
Departure Date: 4 test cases (4 boundary values)
Extra Baggage: 4 test cases (3 boundary values + 1 additional case for 0 baggage)
Service Class: 3 test cases (3 boundary values)
Therefore, the total number of test cases would be:

4 (Distance) * 4 (Departure Date) * 4 (Extra Baggage) * 3 (Service Class) = 192 test cases

Here are the 192 test cases generated based on Boundary Value Analysis (BVA):
1.	Distance = 499, Departure Date = 6, Service Class = Economy, Baggage = 1
2.	Distance = 499, Departure Date = 6, Service Class = Business, Baggage = 1
3.	Distance = 499, Departure Date = 6, Service Class = First, Baggage = 1
