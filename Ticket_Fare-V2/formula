 formula for calculating the flight cost:

For flights less than 500 miles:

Flat rate: $100
For flights between 500 and 1000 miles:

If departing within 7 days: cost = distance * 0.10
If departing within 30 days: cost = distance * 0.08
If departing within 90 days: cost = distance * 0.06
For flights over 1000 miles:

If departing within 7 days: cost = distance * 0.30
If departing within 30 days: cost = distance * 0.25
If departing within 90 days: cost = distance * 0.20
Extra baggage cost:

For flights less than 500 miles: no extra baggage cost
For flights between 500 and 1000 miles: baggage_cost = extra_baggage * $25
For flights over 1000 miles: baggage_cost = extra_baggage * $50
Service class cost:

Business class: cost *= 2
First class: cost *= 3
Total cost:

total_cost = cost + baggage_cost
